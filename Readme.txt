Banking System Project

This is a simple banking system where you can perform the following actions:
- Create account
- Withdraw and deposit money
- Transfer money between accounts
- Display account balance and transaction history
- Save/load account data to/from a file

To compile:
1. Run 'make' in the terminal to compile the project.

To run:
1. Execute './bank' to start the program.

To exit:
1. Type 'q' or 'Q' in the menu.

The accounts' information is saved in the 'accounts.dat' file, so the data persists across sessions.
